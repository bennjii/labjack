### `labjack`

The pure-rust implementation of the LJM Library, avoiding the need to link against the LJM library, and can allow for non-blocking IO.
This does not contain the same API interface as LJM, and is therefore an opinionated set of APIs untoward the LabJack.

> [!CAUTION]
> This library is currently a work in progress and is not complete, it lacks core functionality.
